# 🎵 Python Music Player with Data Structures

A console-based music player implemented in Python demonstrating three fundamental data structures: Circular Linked List, Stack, and Huffman Tree.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements a fully functional music player that showcases:
- **Circular Linked List** for playlist management
- **Stack** for play history tracking
- **Huffman Tree** for song name compression
- **Pygame** for audio playback

## 🏗️ Data Structures Implementation

### Circular Linked List
- Manages music playlist in a circular manner
- Allows seamless navigation between songs
- Maintains current playing song pointer
- Methods: `add_song()`, `next_song()`, `prev_song()`, `display_playlist()`

### Stack
- Tracks played songs for history functionality
- Enables "previous track" navigation
- Methods: `push()`, `pop()`, `peek()`, `is_empty()`, `size()`

### Huffman Tree
- Demonstrates lossless data compression
- Compresses song names using Huffman coding algorithm
- Methods: `encode()`, `decode()`, `build_tree()`, `build_codes()`

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Load songs from folder (MP3, WAV, OGG support)
- ✅ Play, pause, stop functionality
- ✅ Next/previous track navigation
- ✅ Circular playlist navigation
- ✅ Play history tracking
- ✅ Song name compression demonstration
- ✅ Playlist display with current song indicator
- ✅ User-friendly console interface
